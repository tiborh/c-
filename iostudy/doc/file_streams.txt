File I/O is handled by including fstream, which contains the classes
ofstream and ifstream for output and input file-stream creation and manipulation. To
properly open and manage an ifstream or ofstream related to a system file, you must first
declare it with an appropriate constructor.

ifstream();
ifstream(const char*, int = ios::in, int prot = filebuf::openprot);
ofstream();
ofstream(const char*, int = ios::out, int prot = filebuf::openprot);

The constructor of no arguments creates a variable that is later associated
with an input file.
